		description: "Steak, as in most red meats in general, is packed with many beneficial nutrients, including an array of healthy fats, which are good for you (unless you’ve been specifically told otherwise told by your doctor). Red meat is one of the most nutritious meats you’ll eat; especially when it comes from naturally fed and raised animals. We all know how important protein is, and red meat is an excellent source of protein, as well as iron, B12, zinc, dietary creatine, and quite a few other good-for-you nutrients. It’s important to remember that where you meat comes from is key. Good Ranchers steak is sourced from local farms and ranches throughout the United States. Not only do we support local farmers, our meat is 100% American Beef, and our cattle are pasture-raised using the most innovative techniques. These techniques help ensure that every cut of meat is a cut above the rest. Not to mention our beef is aged for a minimum of 21 days, so you can feel confident it’s premium, quality meat each and every time. All of our livestock grow in stress-free environments and never fed anything unnatural.",
